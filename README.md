# zumiLessonMay31st

Recap of last week:  <br>
Last week, we integrated a "mulit-route" system that allowed us to enter multiple routes for Zumi to run on a particualr graph/course vs. the old version that only allowed us to enter one.  In addition, we reviewed all of Arnolds new Zumi functions.  <br>
